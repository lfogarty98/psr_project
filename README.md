# Poisson Surface Reconstruction
This repository contains the code implementation for the Computer Graphics Seminar from TU Berlin (WiSe 2024/25).


## Getting Started

The required packages for the whole implementation can be installed via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
source venv/bin/activate
```

The implementation for both the 2D and 3D cases are located respectively in `source/2d` and `source/3d`. The 2D example is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. For the 3D example, run the following:
```
cd source/3d
python psr_3d.py
```
